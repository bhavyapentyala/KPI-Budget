                        optimization of its operations translating into quantifiable performance outcomes. It is
                        commendable to note that resolution times have continued to improve, largely due to enhancements
                        in triage procedures and the efficiency of the escalation matrix (Lindblom, 2024). These
                        modifications ensure that problems are directed to the right person and solved at the

                        Over four weeks, all key KPIs showed a substantial improvement in the IT support team's
                        performance. We were able to reduce our average ticket resolution time from 5.0 to 3.5 hours,
                        which means our issue processing was becoming quicker, and our internal cooperation was
                        improving. Similarly, customer satisfaction increased from 85% to 91%, surpassing our 90%
                        target, which demonstrates that our new feedback loop and response etiquette training are
                        effective (Barlow, 2022)</p>
